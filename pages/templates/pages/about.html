            is a free online service for musicians and producers, enabling them to upload their work in different music
            libraries or to create their own personal broadcasts.

            sender.fm can also be used for promotional purposes or as a platform to test whether others like your music.
        </p>

        <p>
            non-registered users are able to create as many play lists as they like. they also have the option of rating
            various artistsâ€™ music and commenting on it. only positively rated music will be played on sender.fm.
            currently there is a selection of eight different styles of music.

            in addition to this, registered users have the opportunity to create a profile with pictures that can be
            updated at any point. they can also add comments and pictures to their music, and let other users download
            some of their music or promotional sounds for free.

            adding a link to a personal home page is also possible on sender.fm
